# Auto Blinds Project
The objective is to build a mechanism to automatically open and close blinds.

- Will probably use ESP32 microcontrollers for a wifi connection
- The **ESP32 LOLIN32 Lite** might use less power and still has wifi and bluetooth
- WiFi vs Bluetooth?
- Integrate with mqtt server

## Powerging the circuit

instructable link: <https://www.instructables.com/ESP8266-Li-Ion-Battery-rechargeable-battery-power-/>

the microcontroller is rated for 3.3V so it would be best to get a battery with this operating voltage.
- higher voltage will require a regulator. more parts and higher power consumption
- might be easier to charge something with the same voltage
